1. first name ="Nils" 
2. street =="Pfaffenwaldring"
3. house = 5b
4. zip 70569
5. city = Stuttgart"
6. yearOfBirth=1980

Errors:
1. The space between "first" and "name" coundn't be there, a variable should not have any space in the middle. It should be: firstName = "Nils".
2. It's a condition, not a variable, because "==" instead of the assignment symbol "=". It should be: street = "Pfaffenwaldring".
3. 5b should be a string ("5b"). It should be house = "5b".
4. It's without the assignment variable "=". It should be zip = 70569.
5. The first quotation mark is missing. It should be city = "Stuttgart".
6. It's ok.
